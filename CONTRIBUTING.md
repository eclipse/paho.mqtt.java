Contributing to Paho
====================

Thanks for your interest in this project.

Project description:
--------------------

The Paho project has been created to provide reliable open-source implementations of open and standard messaging protocols aimed at new, existing, and emerging applications for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT).
Paho reflects the inherent physical and cost constraints of device connectivity. Its objectives include effective levels of decoupling between devices and applications, designed to keep markets open and encourage the rapid growth of scalable Web and Enterprise middleware and applications.

Source
------

The Paho Java client and Android service are stored in a git repository. The URLs to access it are:

ssh://<username>@git.eclipse.org:29418/paho/org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.java
https://<username>@git.eclipse.org/r/paho/org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.java

A [web browsable repository](http://git.eclipse.org/c/paho/org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.java.git) is available.

Contributing a patch
--------------------

The Paho repositories are accessed through Gerrit, the code review
project, which makes it possible for anybody to clone the repository, make
changes and push them back for review and eventual acceptance into the project.

To do this, you must follow a few steps. The first of these are described at

- [Contributing via git](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Contributing_via_Git)

* Sign the Eclipse CLA
* Use a valid commit record, including a signed-off-by entry.

There are further details at

- [Handling Git Contributions](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Handling_Git_Contributions)

Once the patch is pushed back to Gerrit, the project committers will be
informed and they will undertake a review of the code. The patch may need
modifying for some reason. In order to make amending commits more
straightforward, the steps at
https://git.eclipse.org/r/Documentation/cmd-hook-commit-msg.html should be
followed. This automatically inserts a "Change-Id" entry to your commit message
which allows you to amend commits and have Gerrit track them as the same
change.

What happens next depends on the content of the patch. If it is 100% authored
by the contributor and is less than 1000 lines (and meets the needs of the
project), then it can be committed to the main repository. If not, more steps
are required. These are detailed in the 
[legal process poster](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/EclipseLegalProcessPoster.pdf).
