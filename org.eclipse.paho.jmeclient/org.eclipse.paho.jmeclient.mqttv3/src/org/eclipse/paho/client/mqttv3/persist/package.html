Contains implementations of the MqttClientPersistence interface.

<p>
An MQTT client needs a persistence mechanism to store messages while they 
are in the process of being delivered. This package contains several 
implementations of the interface.  If a persistence class is not
specified on the constructor to an MQTT client, 
{@link org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.persist.MqttDefaultFilePersistence MqttDefaultFilePersistence} 
is used by default.
